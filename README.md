# Purechain

After spending a lot of time studying blockchains and trying Ethereum, EOS, etc., it's time to create a simple blockchain, for educational purposes. Purechain try to create a fully functional blockchain in functional programming. It means that everything is done using [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/).

# Why PureScript?

I wanted a statically typed functional language, compiling in CLI. There were some options: Scala, PureScript, Haskell, ... But in the end, I didn't want to deal with lazy, and I like Haskell-like languages, so PureScript was an obvious choice.
